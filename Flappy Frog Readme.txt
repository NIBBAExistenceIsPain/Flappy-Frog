*****Flappy Frog*****
*********************

The game starts with the menu screen where the 2 players have to type in their nicknames in the blank fields, and then press 
"Start Game". The players control a frog with 2 different keys per player... one key to jump, and another one to place
a fire-ball behind yourself. The keys were set to "Z"+"X" and "N"+"M" for the player on the left and right respectively.
The players have to dodge/go around the green tubes and also dodge the fire-balls dropped by the opponent. The "X" mark near
the player's nickname represents that a fire-ball can be placed by the player. When hitting a sidewall and turning around, the
players reset their fire-ball charge. You can't stack fire-balls, so no matter if you do or don't use your fire-ball charge,
you can only have 1 maximum. After one of the players dies, the name of the winner is displayed on a victory screen where you
can also choose to play again or go back to the main menu if you are willing to change the nicknames.
